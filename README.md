# Machine Learning Projects
This is a set of machine learing projects that was done as part of the MITx 6.86x: Machine Leanring from linear models to deep learning course on Edx. Projects covers a variety of topics including SVM, kernels, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning ...etc. The projects doesn't involve sikit-learn functions and libraries. The used ML algorithms is implemented from scratch.
The projects are as follows:
1- Automatic Review Analyzer
2- Digit Recognition using different algorithms
3- Movie Rating predictor using Collaborative Learning and EM algorithm
4- Text-based game using Reinforment Learning
